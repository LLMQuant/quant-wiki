In this model, a stock exchange collects transaction fees from auction investors executing block trades to buy or sell a risky asset, then redistributes these fees as rebates to competing market makers submitting limit orders. Market makers influence both the price at which the asset trades and their arrival intensity in the auction. We frame this problem as a principal-multi-agent problem and provide necessary and sufficient conditions to characterize the Nash equilibrium among market makers. The exchange's optimization problem is formulated as a high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation with Poisson jump processes, which is solved using a verification result. To numerically compute the optimal rebate and transaction fee policies, we apply the Deep BSDE method. Our results show that optimal transaction fees and rebate structures improve market efficiency by narrowing the spread between the auction clearing price and the asset's fundamental value, while ensuring a minimal gain for both market makers indexed on the price of the asset on a coexisting limit order book.|\n", "2501.11983": "|**2025-01-21**|**Asset Pricing Model in Markets of Imperfect Information and Subjective Views**|Hafid Lalioui et.al.|[2501.11983](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11983)|null|This paper provides a closed-form market equilibrium formula consolidating informational imperfections and investors' beliefs about assets. Based on Merton's incomplete information model, we characterize the equilibrium expected excess returns vector with asymmetric information. We then derive the corresponding market portfolio as the solution to a non-linear system of equations, and analyze the sensitivities of each asset's extra excess returns to its shadow-costs and market weight. We derive the market reference model for excess returns under random shadow-costs. The conditional posterior distribution of excess returns integrates the pick-matrix and pick-vector of views and the vector of shadow-costs into a multivariate distribution with mean vector and covariance matrix dependent on the model and structure of the considered market reference.|\n"}, "financial time-series forecasting": {"2309.02072": "|**2024-06-01**|**Data Scaling Effect of Deep Learning in Financial Time Series Forecasting**|Chen Liu et.al.|[2309.02072](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02072)|**[link](https://github.com/vbayeslab/deepvol)**|For years, researchers investigated the applications of deep learning in forecasting financial time series. However, they continued to rely on the conventional econometric approach for model training that optimizes the deep learning models on individual assets. This study highlights the importance of global training, where the deep learning model is optimized across a wide spectrum of stocks. Focusing on stock volatility forecasting as an exemplar, we show that global training is not only beneficial but also necessary for deep learning-based financial time series forecasting. We further demonstrate that, given a sufficient amount of training data, a globally trained deep learning model is capable of delivering accurate zero-shot forecasts for any stocks.|\n"}, "financial large language model": {}}
